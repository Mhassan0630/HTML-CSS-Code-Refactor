# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description:

This is a professional website for a fictional company named Horiseon that offers Digital Marketing Services. The website serves as a platform to introduce the services provided by Horiseon which include Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. The website is built with accessibility in mind and is optimized for search engines.

## Why did I build this?

The primary purpose of building this website was to demonstrate my skills in web development, particularly in HTML and CSS. It showcases my ability to write semantic HTML, apply advanced CSS techniques, and ensure web accessibility. It is also a platform for the fictional company to represent its business and services online.

## What I learned

Throughout the development of this project, I enhanced my understanding of semantic HTML elements and how they contribute to the structure and accessibility of a website. I also learned how to efficiently use CSS selectors and properties to style web pages and how to improve code readability and maintenance by avoiding repetition in CSS code. Additionally, I grasped the importance of using alt attributes for images to improve web accessibility and SEO.

## Refactor Changes:

I have made several changes to the original code to improve its readability and efficiency. These changes include:

1. I replaced several non-semantic HTML elements with semantic ones to improve the structure and accessibility of the website.
2. I added alt attributes to all images to make them accessible to screen readers and to improve SEO.
3. I corrected the CSS file structure to match the semantics of the HTML.
4. I consolidated several CSS rules that contained duplicate code to make the CSS file shorter and easier to maintain.
5. I added comments to both HTML and CSS files to improve their readability and ease of understanding for other developers.
